1) write a programm in JS that creates an HTTP server, the endpoint /work should sleep 100ms.
2) write the same program in python using flask
3) write a program in node that is invoked as follow:
  node bench.js URL N_REQUESTS N_CONCURRENT
    The program should perform a total of N_REQUESTS to the URL in question, and doing it with N_CONCURRENT connections.
    The program should print at the end how many replies it got grouped by HTTP status code (200, etc.)
    It should also print the average response time (latency) by status code.
    print total time to complete the N_REQUESTS.
